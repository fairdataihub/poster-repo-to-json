# License Policy for posters.science Corpus

## Principle

Structured JSON extraction from a scientific poster constitutes a derivative work.
If the poster's license does not clearly grant permission to redistribute derivatives,
we strip the extracted content and keep only the repository metadata (identifiers,
creators, titles, dates, publisher, rights, funding, etc.).

## Allowed Licenses (whitelist)

These licenses explicitly permit derivative works. Extracted poster content is **kept**.

## Blocked Licenses (blocklist)

These do **not** grant derivative/redistribution rights. Extracted content is **stripped**;
only repository metadata is retained.

| Category | Licenses | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| No-Derivatives | CC-BY-ND-\*, CC-BY-NC-ND-\* (all versions) | ND explicitly prohibits derivative works |
| Restrictive | All Rights Reserved, In Copyright | No redistribution permitted |
| Unresolved | Copyright not evaluated, Copyright undetermined | Cannot confirm permission |
| Unknown terms | other-at, other-closed, other-nc, other | No defined license terms to evaluate |
| Empty/null | (missing rightsList) | Cannot confirm permission; assume restrictive |

## What gets stripped

When a poster's license is blocked, the following poster2json-derived fields are removed:

- `content` (extracted text sections)
- `descriptions` (LLM-generated abstracts)
- `imageCaptions` (extracted figure captions)
- `tableCaptions` (extracted table captions)
- `researchField` (model-classified domain)

A `_license_blocked: true` flag is added to mark the JSON as policy-stripped.

Fields that are **kept** (repository metadata, not derived from poster content):

- `identifiers`, `relatedIdentifiers`
- `creators`, `contributors`
- `titles`
- `publisher`, `publicationYear`
- `subjects`, `dates`
- `rightsList`
- `fundingReferences`
- `conference`
- `formats`, `sizes`, `version`
- `language`
- `$schema`

## Pipeline integration

License enforcement runs as a default post-processing step after merge and before
Azure sync. See `scripts/post_processing/enforce_license_policy.py`.

The policy definitions (whitelist/blocklist) live in
`scripts/post_processing/license_policy.py`.
